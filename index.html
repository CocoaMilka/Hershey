						Welcome to my website! I'm Cocoa, a freelance artist who specializes in 2D and 3D art. If you would like to see some of my previous work, check out the Gallery tab, otherwise here's a little about this site. I created this website sort of as a tribute to the early 2000s internet which I grew up in. This site was entirely written by hand only using techniques that existed in the early 2000s.
